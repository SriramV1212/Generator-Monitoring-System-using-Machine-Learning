A machine learning-based solution for predicting maintenance needs and monitoring diesel generator parameters in real-time.

## üìä Project Overview

This project implements a predictive maintenance system for diesel generators using machine learning algorithms to analyze time series data. The system monitors critical parameters 
such as:

1. **Coolant Temperature**  
2. **Oil Pressure**  
3. **Vibration Levels**  
4. **Exhaust Gas Temperature**  
5. **Fuel Consumption Rate**  
6. **Battery Voltage**  
7. **Engine Speed (RPM)**  
8. **Load Current**  
9. **Frequency (Hz)**  
10. **Running Hours**

The machine learning model predicts potential issues like the ones listed above, before they cause failures, reducing downtime and maintenance costs.

### üéØ Key Features
- Machine learning models for predictive analytics
